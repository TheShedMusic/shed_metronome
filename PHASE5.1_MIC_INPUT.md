# Phase 5.1: Microphone Input Implementation

## Completed: October 16, 2025

### What Was Implemented

We successfully added microphone input capture to the Core Audio render callback. This is the first step in real-time audio mixing.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Added Input Buffer Properties
**File:** `CoreAudioMetronome.swift`

Added properties to store the input buffer that we'll reuse on every render cycle:
```swift
/// Input buffer for pulling mic samples (allocated once, reused)
private var inputBufferList: UnsafeMutableAudioBufferListPointer?
private var inputBufferListStorage: UnsafeMutablePointer<AudioBufferList>?
```

#### 2. Created `setupInputBuffer()` Method
Allocates a reusable buffer for pulling mic samples:
- Allocates for 2 channels (mono or stereo mic)
- Max buffer size: 4096 samples
- Called once during audio unit initialization
- Efficient: buffer is reused every render cycle

#### 3. Updated `shutdown()` Method
Added proper deallocation of input buffers to prevent memory leaks.

#### 4. Modified `renderCallback()` - The Critical Change
This is where the magic happens! The render callback now:

1. **Pulls mic samples using `AudioUnitRender()`**
   - Only when recording (`isRecording == true`)
   - Pulls from bus 1 (input bus)
   - Uses the same `timeStamp` for perfect sync
   - Handles mono or stereo mic input

2. **Generates click sounds** (as before)
   - Creates click audio in output buffers

3. **Mixes mic and clicks in real-time**
   - Simple addition: `left[i] += micL[i]`
   - Both mic and clicks combined before output
   - Monitoring: hear yourself + clicks with near-zero latency
   - Recording: mixed audio goes to output (ready for circular buffer in Phase 5.3)

### How It Works

```
Render Callback Flow:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. AudioUnitRender() pulls mic samples     │
│    from input bus into inputBufferList      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 2. generateClicks() creates click audio    │
│    in output buffers                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 3. Mix: output[i] += mic[i]                │
│    (mic audio added to clicks)              │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 4. Mixed audio sent to output               │
│    (headphones/speaker)                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Benefits

1. **Sample-Accurate Timing**
   - Both mic and clicks use the same `AudioTimeStamp`
   - No separate timing domains
   - Perfect synchronization guaranteed

2. **Near-Zero Latency Monitoring**
   - User hears themselves + clicks immediately
   - No perceptible delay
   - Same as professional DAWs

3. **Unified Render Callback**
   - All audio processing in one place
   - Lock-free and real-time safe
   - Deterministic performance

### Testing Instructions

1. Save all files in Xcode (Cmd+S)
2. Commit changes to shed_metronome
3. Push to git
4. Run `flutter pub upgrade` in app
5. Build and run on device
6. Start metronome
7. **Press record**
8. **You should now hear yourself + clicks with no delay!**

### What to Test

- ✅ Click playback still works
- ✅ Accent beats still work
- ✅ Tick callbacks still fire
- ✅ When recording, you hear yourself + clicks
- ✅ No audio glitches or dropouts
- ❌ Recording won't save yet (that's Phase 5.3-5.4)

### Current Limitations

1. **No file writing yet**
   - Audio is mixed and played back
   - But not saved to disk
   - Phase 5.3 will add circular buffer
   - Phase 5.4 will add file writer

2. **No volume control**
   - Mic and clicks at full volume
   - Will add in Phase 5.2 refinements

### Next Steps: Phase 5.3

Write the mixed audio to the circular buffer so we can save it to disk:

1. Initialize `CircularBuffer<Float>` when recording starts
2. After mixing, write samples to circular buffer
3. Handle buffer full conditions gracefully
4. Prepare for file writer thread (Phase 5.4)

### Architecture Status

```
✅ Phase 1: Infrastructure (CircularBuffer, AudioFormat helpers)
✅ Phase 2: I/O Unit Setup (AVAudioSession, Remote I/O configuration)
✅ Phase 3: Basic Render Callback (click playback only)
✅ Phase 4: Accent beats, tick callbacks, path handling
✅ Phase 5.1: Microphone input capture ← YOU ARE HERE
⏳ Phase 5.2: (Actually already done! Mixing implemented)
⏳ Phase 5.3: Write to circular buffer
⏳ Phase 5.4: File writer thread
⏳ Phase 6: Integration testing
```

### Important Notes

- **Real-time safety**: All operations in render callback are lock-free
- **Memory management**: Input buffer allocated once, reused forever
- **Error handling**: `AudioUnitRender` failures are silent (keeps audio flowing)
- **Mono/stereo**: Handles both mono and stereo mic input
- **Sample-accurate**: Uses same timestamp for input and output

This is a major milestone! The hardest part of Core Audio implementation is complete. Now we just need to save the mixed audio to disk.
